# jsWeb
This is a Javascript Framework I am working on that will allow you to make a website with minimal HTML.
The webpage will be writen in javascript using the functions I have defined.
All that has to be inside the HTML file is the usual setup (html, body, and script tag).
I will be updating this repo with more features in the future as I work more on it.
